 *
 * Driver authors must implement the routines defined here, providing an
 * instance with the fields filled out.  After that, the instance must
 * be registered in flash.c, so it can be used by the driver lookup system.
 *
 * Specifically, the user can issue the command: @par
 * @code
 * flash bank DRIVERNAME ...parameters...
 * @endcode
 *
 * OpenOCD will search for the driver with a @c flash_driver::name
 * that matches @c DRIVERNAME.
 *
 * The flash subsystem calls some of the other drivers routines a using
 * corresponding static <code>flash_driver_<i>callback</i>()</code>
 * routine in flash.c.
