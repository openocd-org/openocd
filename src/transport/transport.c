/** @file
 * Infrastructure for specifying and managing the transport protocol
 * used in a given debug or programming session.
 *
 * Examples of "debug-capable" transports are JTAG or SWD.
 * Additionally, JTAG supports boundary scan testing.
 *
 * Examples of "programming-capable" transports include SPI or UART;
 * those are used (often mediated by a ROM bootloader) for ISP style
 * programming, to perform an initial load of code into flash, or
 * sometimes into SRAM.  Target code could use "variant" options to
 * decide how to use such protocols.  For example, Cortex-M3 cores
 * from TI/Luminary and from NXP use different protocols for for
 * UART or SPI based firmware loading.
 *
 * As a rule, there are protocols layered on top of the transport.
 * For example, different chip families use JTAG in different ways
 * for debugging.  Also, each family that supports programming over
 * a UART link for initial firmware loading tends to define its own
 * messaging and error handling.
