# - for apptrace: 2x16KB up buffers + 32KB down buffer
# - for uncompression: 32KB for unzip buffer size + 11KB for inflator data structs
# TODO: In general when up buffers are swapped apptrace copies `host->target` data from new up buffer to down buffer to free space for `target->host` data.
# In case of flash writes we use apptrace transfers in one direction only. So we can avoid copying and re-use up buffer instead of down one.
