Welcome to OpenOCD!
===================

OpenOCD provides on-chip programming and debugging support with a
layered architecture of JTAG interface and TAP support, debug target
support (e.g. ARM, MIPS), and flash chip drivers (e.g. CFI, NAND, etc.).
Several network interfaces are available for interactiving with OpenOCD:
HTTP, telnet, TCL, and GDB.  The GDB server enables OpenOCD to function
as a "remote target" for source-level debugging of embedded systems
using the GNU GDB program.

This README file contains an overview of the following topics:
- how to find and build more OpenOCD documentation,
- the build process
- packaging tips.
- configuration options

=====================
OpenOCD Documentation
=====================

In addition to in-tree documentation, the latest documentation may be
viewed on-line at the following URLs:

 OpenOCD User's Guide:
    http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/html/index.html

 OpenOCD Developer's Manual:
    http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/doxygen/index.html

These reflect the latest development versions, so the following section
introduces how to build the complete documentation from the package.


For more information, refer to these documents or contact the developers
by subscribing to the OpenOCD developer mailing list:

	openocd-development@lists.berlios.de

Building the OpenOCD Documentation
----------------------------------

The OpenOCD User's Guide can be produced in two different format:

  # If PDFVIEWER is set, this creates and views the PDF User Guide.
  make pdf && ${PDFVIEWER} doc/openocd.pdf

  # If HTMLVIEWER is set, this creates and views the HTML User Guide.
  make html && ${HTMLVIEWER} doc/openocd.html/index.html

The OpenOCD Developer Manual contains information about the internal
architecture and other details about the code:

  # NB! make sure doxygen is installed, type doxygen --version
  make doxygen

  # If HTMLVIEWER is set, this views the HTML Doxygen output.
  ${HTMLVIEWER} doxygen/index.html

The remaining sections describe how to configure the system such that
you can build the in-tree documentation.

==================
Installing OpenOCD
==================

On Linux, you may have permissions problems to address.  The best way
to do this is to use the contrib/openocd.udev rules file.  It probably
belongs somewhere in /etc/udev/rules.d, but consult your operating
system documentation to be sure.  In particular, make sure that it
matches the syntax used by your operating system's version of udev.

A Note to OpenOCD Users
-----------------------

If you would rather be working "with" OpenOCD rather than "on" it, your
operating system or JTAG interface supplier may provide binaries for
you in a convenient-enough package.

Such packages may be more stable than git mainline, where bleeding-edge
development takes place.  These "Packagers" produce binary releases of
OpenOCD after the developers produces new "release" versions of the
source code.  Previous versions of OpenOCD cannot be used to diagnose
problems with the current release, so users are encouraged to keep in
contact with their distribution package maintainers or interface vendors
to ensure suitable upgrades appear regularly.

Users of these binary versions of OpenOCD must contact their Packager to
ask for support or newer versions of the binaries; the OpenOCD
developers do not support packages directly.

A Note to OpenOCD Packagers
---------------------------

You are a PACKAGER of OpenOCD if you:

- Sell dongles: and include pre-built binaries
- Supply tools: A complete development solution
- Supply IDEs: like Eclipse, or RHIDE, etc.
- Build packages: RPM files, or DEB files for a Linux Distro

As a PACKAGER, you will experience first reports of most issues.
When you fix those problems for your users, your solution may help
prevent hundreds (if not thousands) of other questions from other users.

If something does not work for you, please work to inform the OpenOCD
developers know how to improve the system or documentation to avoid
future problems, and follow-up to help us ensure the issue will be fully
resolved in our future releases.

That said, the OpenOCD developers would also like you to follow a few
suggestions:

- Send patches, including config files, upstream.
- Always build with printer ports enabled.
- Use libftdi + libusb for FT2232 support.

Remember, the FTD2XX library cannot be used in binary distributions, due
to restrictions of the GPL v2.

================
Building OpenOCD
================

The INSTALL file contains generic instructions for running 'configure'
and compiling the OpenOCD source code.  That file is provided by default
for all GNU automake packages.  If you are not familiar with the GNU
autotools, then you should read those instructions first.

The remainder of this document tries to provide some instructions for
those looking for a quick-install.

OpenOCD Dependencies
--------------------

Presently, GCC is required to build OpenOCD.  The developers have begun
to enforce strict code warnings (-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and more) and
use C99-specific features: inline functions, named initializers, mixing
declarations with code, and other tricks.  While it may be possible to
use other compilers, they must be somewhat modern and could require
extending support to conditionally remove GCC-specific extensions.

Also, you need to install the appropriate driver files, if you want to
build support for a USB or FTDI-based interface:

- ft2232, jlink, rlink, vsllink, usbprog, arm-jtag-ew:
  - libusb: required for portable communication with USB dongles
- ft2232 also requires:
  - libftdi: http://www.intra2net.com/opensource/ftdi/  *OR*
  - ftd2xx: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm,
    or the Amontec version (from http://www.amontec.com), for
    easier support of JTAGkey's vendor and product IDs.

Many Linux distributions provide these packages through their automated
installation and update mechanisms; however, some Linux versions include
older versions of libftdi.  In particular, using Ubuntu 8.04 has been
problematic, but newer versions of Ubuntu do not have this problem.

Compiling OpenOCD
-----------------

To build OpenOCD (on both Linux and Cygwin), use the following sequence
of commands:

   ./configure [with some options listed in the next section]
   make
   make install

The 'configure' step generates the Makefiles required to build OpenOCD,
usually with one or more options provided to it.  The first 'make' step
will build OpenOCD and place the final executable in ./src/.  The
final (optional) step, ``make install'', places all of the files in the
required location.

Cross-Compiling Options
-----------------------

To cross-compile, you must specify both --build and --host options to
the 'configure' script.  For example, you can configure OpenOCD to
cross-compile on a x86 Linux host to run on Windows (MinGW32), you could
use the following configuration options:

  ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc ...

Likewise, the following options allow OpenOCD to be cross-compiled for
an ARM target on the same x86 host:

  ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=arm-elf ...

Both must be specified to work around bugs in autoconf.

Scripts for producing ARM cross-compilers can be found on the web with a
little searching.  A script to produce an x86 Linux-hosted MinGW32
cross-compiler can be downloaded from the following URL:

  http://www.mingw.org/wiki/LinuxCrossMinGW

Configuration Options
---------------------

The configure script takes numerous options, specifying which JTAG
interfaces should be included (among other things).  The following list
of options was extracted from the output of './configure --help'.  Other
options may be available there:

  --enable-maintainer-mode  enable make rules and dependencies not useful
                          (and sometimes confusing) to the casual installer
			  NOTE: This option is *required* for GIT builds!
			  It should *not* be used to build a release.

  --enable-static[=PKGS]  build static libraries [default=yes]

Parallel Port Dongles
---------------------

If you want to access the parallel port using the PPDEV interface you
have to specify both --enable-parport AND --enable-parport-ppdev, since the
the later option is an option to the parport driver (see
http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=3795 for more info).

The same is true for the --enable-parport-giveio option, you
have to use both the --enable-parport AND the --enable-parport-giveio
option if you want to use giveio instead of ioperm parallel port access
method.

FT2232C Based USB Dongles
-------------------------

There are 2 methods of using the FTD2232, either (1) using the
FTDICHIP.COM closed source driver, or (2) the open (and free) driver
libftdi.

Using LIBFTDI
-------------

The libftdi source code can be download from the following website:

  http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php

For both Linux and Windows, both libusb and libftdi must be built and
installed.  To use the newer FT2232H chips, supporting RTCK and USB high
speed (480 Mbps), use libftdi version 0.17 or newer.  Many Linux
distributions provide suitable packages for these libraries.

For Windows, libftdi is supported with versions 0.14 and later.

With these prerequisites met, configure the libftdi solution like this:

  ./configure --prefix=/path/for/your/install --enable-ft2232_libftdi

Then type ``make'', and perhaps ``make install''.

Using FTDI's FTD2XX
-------------------

The (closed source) FTDICHIP.COM solution is faster on MS-Windows.  That
is the motivation for supporting it even though its licensing restricts
it to non-redistributable OpenOCD binaries, and it is not available for
all operating systems used with OpenOCD.  You may, however, build such
copies for personal use.

The FTDICHIP drivers come as either a (win32) ZIP file, or a (Linux)
TAR.GZ file. You must unpack them ``some where'' convenient. As of this
writing FTDICHIP does not supply means to install these files "in an
appropriate place."

If your distribution does not package these, there are several
'./configure' options to solve this problem:

  --with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir
                          Where (CYGWIN/MINGW) the zip file from ftdichip.com
                          was unpacked <default=search>
  --with-ftd2xx-linux-tardir
                          Where (Linux/Unix) the tar file from ftdichip.com
                          was unpacked <default=search>
  --with-ftd2xx-lib       Use static or shared ftd2xx libs on default static

If you are using the FTDICHIP.COM driver, download and unpack the
Windows or Linux FTD2xx drivers from the following location:

	http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

Remember, this library is binary-only, while OpenOCD is licenced
according to GNU GPLv2 without any exceptions.  That means that
_distributing_ copies of OpenOCD built with the FTDI code would violate
the OpenOCD licensing terms.

Linux Notes
***********

The Linux tar.gz archive contains a directory named libftd2xx0.4.16
(or similar).  Assuming that you have extracted this archive in the same
directory as the OpenOCD package, you could configure with options like
the following:

   ./configure \
        --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx \
        --with-ft2xx-linux-tardir=../libftd2xx0.4.16 \
	... other options ...

Note that on Linux there is no good reason to use these FTDI binaries;
they are no faster (on Linux) than libftdi, and cause licensing issues.

==========================
Obtaining OpenOCD From GIT
==========================

You can download the current GIT version with a GIT client of your
choice from the main repository:

   git://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openocd/openocd

You may prefer to use a mirror:

   http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd.git
   git://repo.or.cz/openocd.git

Using the GIT command line client, you might use the following command
to set up a local copy of the current repository (make sure there is no
directory called "openocd" in the current directory):

   git clone git://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openocd/openocd

Then you can update that at your convenience using

   git pull

There is also a gitweb interface, which you can use either to browse
the repository or to download arbitrary snapshots using HTTP:

   http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd
   http://repo.or.cz/w/openocd.git

Snapshots are compressed tarballs of the source tree, about 1.3 MBytes
each at this writing.


Tips For Building From a GIT Repository
---------------------------------------

Building OpenOCD from a repository requires a recent version of the GNU
autotools (autoconf >= 2.59 and automake >= 1.9).

1) Run './bootstrap' to create the 'configure' script and prepare
   the build process for your host system.

2) Run './configure --enable-maintainer-mode' with other options.
