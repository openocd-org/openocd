The loader relies on the romapi provided by HPMicro devices.

- hpm_common.h and all the hpm_romapi_*.c/h are reused from hpm_sdk
(v1.9.0 https://github.com/hpmicro/hpm_sdk/releases).

Due to different coding rules, these source code needs to be updated
accordingly to pass the coding rule check for openocd.
