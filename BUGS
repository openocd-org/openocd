Please report bugs by posting a message to 

openocd-development@lists.berlios.de.

To minimize work for OpenOCD developers, you can include
all the information below.  If you feel that some of the
items below are unecessary for a clear bug report, you
leave them out.


- Target PCB/board description
- Config scripts
- OpenOCD command line
- List of commands issued or GDB operations performed
- Expected result
- Actual result
- debug_level 3 logs
- If this is a regression, include logs for working and broken
version
- If this is a regression, please find out the precise version
that caused the regression. This can be done via a binary
search. E.g. if version 550 worked and 600 failed, then try
575, etc.

- If OpenOCD is crashing, you can use GDB to get a trace:

gdb --args openocd ....
(gdb) run
(gdb) bt
=> here a stack trace is dumped.
